  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      imgen drives the Codex CLI, which Homebrew does not package. Install it separately:
        npm install -g @openai/codex && codex login

      Its image tool must be enabled — `codex features list` should report:
        image_generation  stable  true

      Preview quality depends on the terminal. imgen prints the protocol it resolved in its
      header: kitty and sixel draw real pixels, blocks is the universal half-block fallback.

    # A TUI needs a terminal, so the check is that the binary loads and finds its library path
